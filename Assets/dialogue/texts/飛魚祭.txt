Flying fish (AliBangBang) is the most important food for Lanyu people and...
one of the main sources of animal protein. 
Catching flying fish is the core of the traditional culture of Lanyu Yami/Dawu people. 
Every spring, the group of flying fish will come to the waters near Lanyu with the Kuroshio Current. 
At this time, Lanyu people will hold a festival to attract flying fish (MIVANWA). 
After the festival, they will start to catch flying fish, which is the beginning of flying fish season.
Lanyu people will hold another ceremony in summer to stop catching the flying fish of that year and catch other fish species; 
after the Mid-Autumn Festival, no flying fish will be eaten and the uneaten flying fish will be discarded.
